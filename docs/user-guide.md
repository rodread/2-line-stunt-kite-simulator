# Stunt Kite Simulator - User Guide

This guide will help you learn how to fly a virtual stunt kite in our simulator. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced kite flyer, this guide will teach you the basics and help you perform impressive stunts.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Interface

When you launch the simulator, you'll see:

1. **The Kite** - A colorful stunt kite in the center of your view
2. **Controls Panel** - Located at the bottom left of the screen
3. **Telemetry Panel** - Located at the top right of the screen
4. **Info Overlay** - Located at the top left, showing FPS and help button

### Basic Controls

The simulator supports both keyboard and UI controls:

#### Keyboard Controls
- **Left Arrow** - Pull left line (turns kite left)
- **Right Arrow** - Pull right line (turns kite right)
- **Up Arrow** - Shorten both lines (power)
- **Down Arrow** - Lengthen both lines (depower)
- **R Key** - Reset kite position
- **Space** - Reset kite position

#### UI Controls
- **Left Line Slider** - Controls left line tension
- **Right Line Slider** - Controls right line tension
- **Line Length Slider** - Adjusts overall line length
- **Wind Speed Slider** - Controls wind strength
- **Kite Selection Dropdown** - Choose different kite types

#### Camera Controls
- **Mouse Drag** - Rotate camera view
- **Mouse Wheel** - Zoom in/out
- **Right-Click + Drag** - Pan camera

## Understanding Kite Flight

### The Wind Window

Stunt kites fly in what's called the "wind window" - a hemispherical area downwind from the pilot. The kite's position in this window affects its speed and maneuverability:

- **Edge of Window** (sides) - Slower, less power
- **Center of Window** - Fastest, most power
- **Top of Window** - Stable, less speed
- **Bottom of Window** - More speed, more challenging

### Reading Telemetry

The telemetry panel provides important flight data:

- **Wind Speed** - Current wind velocity (mph)
- **Kite Speed** - How fast the kite is moving (mph)
- **Angle of Attack** - Angle between kite and wind (degrees)
- **Loops (CW/CCW)** - Number of completed loops in each direction

## Basic Flying Techniques

### Launching the Kite

1. Start with the kite in its default position
2. Ensure wind speed is at a moderate level (40-60%)
3. Apply gentle, equal tension on both lines (50%)
4. The kite will begin to rise in the wind window

### Steering

Steering is achieved through differential line tension:

- **To Turn Left**: Pull left line (increase tension) while easing right line
- **To Turn Right**: Pull right line (increase tension) while easing left line
- **To Fly Straight**: Apply equal tension to both lines

### Speed Control

Kite speed is controlled through line length and position in the wind window:

- **To Speed Up**: Fly towards the center of the wind window
- **To Slow Down**: Fly towards the edge of the wind window
- **Power Stroke**: Quickly pull both lines simultaneously for a burst of speed

## Advanced Techniques

### Performing Loops

1. Start with the kite flying horizontally
2. Pull firmly on one line (left for clockwise, right for counter-clockwise)
3. Maintain the pull through the entire loop
4. Ease off as the kite completes the loop to avoid over-rotation

### Figure Eights

1. Perform a right-hand loop by pulling the right line
2. As the kite comes out of the loop, transition to left line pull
3. Perform a left-hand loop
4. Repeat to create a continuous figure eight pattern

### Landing

1. Fly the kite towards the edge of the wind window
2. Gradually reduce line tension
3. Allow the kite to descend slowly
4. As the kite approaches the ground, equalize line tension for a gentle landing

## Different Kite Types

The simulator offers several kite types, each with unique flight characteristics:

### Standard Stunt Kite
- **Weight**: Medium
- **Speed**: Medium
- **Stability**: Medium
- **Ideal for**: Learning basics and general flying

### Delta Kite
- **Weight**: Light
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Stability**: Low
- **Ideal for**: Advanced tricks and precision flying

### Precision Stunt Kite
- **Weight**: Heavy
- **Speed**: Slow
- **Stability**: High
- **Ideal for**: Controlled maneuvers and precise patterns

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with light winds** - Begin with 30-40% wind speed while learning
2. **Use small, smooth inputs** - Avoid jerky, large control movements
3. **Keep the kite moving** - Stunt kites require forward momentum to maintain control
4. **Practice basic turns** before attempting loops and tricks
5. **Watch your angle of attack** - A value between 5-15Â° provides the best control
6. **Reset if you crash** - Use the R key to quickly reset the kite
7. **Adjust the camera view** to maintain perspective during complex maneuvers

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Kite immediately crashes when launched
**Solution**: Increase wind speed, ensure equal line tension

**Problem**: Kite feels too sensitive
**Solution**: Choose a heavier kite type or reduce wind speed

**Problem**: Kite won't perform loops
**Solution**: Ensure you're pulling firmly enough on one line and maintain tension through the loop

**Problem**: Camera view is disorienting
**Solution**: Reset camera with a double click or use the reset button

## Enjoying the Simulator

The stunt kite simulator is designed to be both educational and enjoyable. Take your time to master the basic techniques before attempting advanced maneuvers. As you gain experience, you'll be able to perform impressive aerial displays with precision and control.

Happy flying!
